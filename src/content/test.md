>>>

Gatsby is a static-site generator using React and GraphQL. One advantage of
utilizing a shared toolset with normal web development is the sheer limitless
customization options available to sites built with Gatsby. While most topics
are covered by [very good tutorials](), some custom website ideas might be
difficult to realize without a good footing in Javascript.

When learning medicine I have been using [Duale Reihe]() books by Thieme, which
are very popular amongst German medicine students. A feature of these textbooks
is the two-column layouting, which presents a detailed version on the inner
column and the abbreviated contents on the outer columns. This allows one to use
the book efficiently for both looking up key facts quickly or reading up on them
with more explanation and exposition.

Unnecessary wordyness can be real drag if you are only after the key facts
provided by a blog post. Fortunately you can now TLDR on the right column, if
this has been too much for you!

If you want to know more details on how and why it is working, keep up on the left
side!.
